# METRICS — Scorecard

> Capture a **baseline** first, then measure again after Phase 2 and Phase 3.

## KPI Table

| KPI | Baseline | After Phase 2 (Automation) | After Phase 3 (AI) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Lead response time (minutes) |  |  |  | Target: < 15 min |
| Leads per month (count) |  |  |  |  |
| Quote turnaround time (hours) |  |  |  | Target: < 24 hrs |
| Hours saved/week (ops/admin) |  |  |  | Estimate hrs saved × hourly rate |
| Conversion (lead→job) |  |  |  | Track monthly |
| Cost savings ($/month) |  |  |  | Hours saved × hourly rate |

## Data Collection
- Use Wix Inbox export or Google Sheet to log leads and timestamps.
- For response time: measure submit timestamp → first reply timestamp.
- For hours saved: list tasks automated × time per task × frequency.
