## 1) Project Overview
ASAP Security needed a clean security‑focused site and faster lead handling. The plan: ship a new website quickly, wire up automations, then add AI agents to lower response times and increase conversion.

**Objectives**
- Increase qualified leads and response speed
- Reduce manual admin (email triage, scheduling, FAQs)
- Create measurable ROI from AI + automation

---

## 2) Scope & Phases
### Phase 1 — Website (Wix Studio)
- Hero + Services, **Why Choose Us**, Contact page
- Lead form → email notifications/CRM
- Mobile polish, on‑page SEO basics (titles/meta/alt)

### Phase 2 — Automation
- Auto‑tag leads; confirm emails/SMS
- Optional: calendar routing, quote intake form, lightweight CRM
- Zapier/Make or Wix Automations, Google Workspace

### Phase 3 — AI Agents
- **Public:** site chatbot (FAQ, services, pre‑qualify, handoff to form)
- **Internal:** ops assistant (draft emails, schedule, follow‑up tasks)
- Knowledge source: internal docs / GitHub `PROMPTS.md` and policies

---

## 3) Deliverables
- Public website URL (Wix)  
- Automation workflows (diagram + config notes)  
- AI agent prompts/configs (non‑secret)  
- Case study with metrics (see `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md`)

## 4) Metrics (how we measure ROI)
See `METRICS.md` for the scorecard. Key KPIs:
- **Lead response time** (minutes)
- **Leads per month** (count)
- **Quote turnaround time** (hours)
- **Hours saved/week** (ops/admin)
- **Conversion rate** (lead → booked job)
- **Cost savings** (estimate from hours saved × hourly rate)
